          <h3>Veterinary bills</h3>
          <p class="body">
            Older and abused dogs tend to come to us with several health and the
            cost of medical treatment can become unaffordable with the number of
            rescues we have. Your kind donation will help us pay for pay for
            surgeries, medical procedures and medication.

          <h3>Senior dogs retirement</h3>
          <p class="body">
            After giving their best years to previous families, it’s unfair and
            sad to put dogs down for being old, and we’re not ready to give up
            on them! It’s hard for seniors to get adopted, so we’re raising
            funds to build a retirement home for them to live out their
            remaining days in comfort.

          <h3>Food & Nutrition</h3>
          <p class="body">
            Some of our foster carers are kind enough to provide for the dogs
            under their care, but with the increasing number of dogs we rescue,
            and strict dietary requirements for some of the dogs due to health
            reasons, we do need a little help to feed them.

          <h3>Maintenance</h3>
          <p class="body">
            Some of the dogs we have at the rescue requires more than just a
            shampoo and nail clipping. Your donations will help us purchase
            grooming tools, and visits to a professional groomer when it’s
            required. You’ll also help us pay for flea & heartworm prevention
            treatments.
