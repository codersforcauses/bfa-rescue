          <h2>Global Canine Vaccination Guidelines</h2>
          <br class="small" />
          <p>
            There are two sets of canine vaccination guidelines available: those
            produced by the American Animal Hospital Association [1] and those
            from the WSAVA VGG [2]. The fundamental principle of both sets of
            guidelines, as encapsulated by the VGG, is that ‘we should aim to
            vaccinate every animal with core vaccines and to vaccinate each
            individual less frequently by only giving non-core vaccines that are
            necessary for that animal’.
          </p>
          <p>
            The WSAVA guidelines suggest that we should aim to vaccinate MORE
            animals. This relates to the phenomenon of ‘herd immunity’. Herd
            immunity suggests that where at least 75% of a herd of animals is
            vaccinated, it is difficult for an infectious disease outbreak to
            occur. The ‘herd’ for a small animal practitioner is the population
            of dogs living within his or her practice area – and our aim should
            be to have as many of these animals vaccinated as possible, in order
            to reduce the chances of disease outbreak in the herd. This is
            particularly important in the context of canine rabies. Where a mass
            vaccination campaign results in at least 70% of the dog population
            receiving vaccine, there is marked impact on the prevalence of
            canine and human rabies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to apply the principles of vaccination guidelines, it is
            firstly necessary to understand the definitions of ‘core’ and
            ‘non-core’ vaccines. CORE vaccines are those that all animals should
            receive to protect them against diseases of global significance or
            where legislation may dictate [i.e. canine rabies]. The use of
            NON-CORE vaccines is dictated by geographical location, lifestyle
            and exposure risk. Some vaccines are NOT RECOMMENDED because there
            is little scientific justification for their use.
          </p>
          <p>
            For dogs, the core vaccines are those that protect against canine
            distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus (CAV) and canine
            parvovirus-2 (CPV). In any country in which rabies is an endemic
            disease, then rabies vaccination is also considered core for dogs.
            Non-core canine vaccines include those that protect against
            leptospirosis, canine parainfluenza virus (CPi), Bordetella
            bronchiseptica and Borrelia. Canine coronavirus (CCV) vaccine is not
            recommended as there is little evidence that CCV is a primary
            enteric pathogen or that the vaccine can protect against such
            infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            WSAVA guidelines provide generic advice to practitioners, but it is
            impossible to ensure that the guidelines are tailored to best fit
            the local situation in each of the 78 WSAVA member countries. The
            VGG encourages national associations to adapt and modify the
            guidelines for local use where appropriate. This process might
            involve altering the classification of a vaccine. For example, in
            the UK, Leptospira vaccine is considered core for the dog and
            attempts are now being made to provide data that define disease
            prevalence [3].
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Core Vaccination of Puppies</h2>
          <br class="small" />
          <p>
            The vaccination of puppies is determined by the transfer of
            maternally-derived antibody (MDA) from the bitch in colostrum. This
            antibody is crucial for protection of the pup during early life, but
            simultaneously blocks the endogenous immune response of the puppy to
            vaccination. Canine immunoglobulin has a half life of around 11 days
            and there is progressive decline in MDA concentrations in pups over
            the first weeks of life. The ‘window of susceptibility’ occurs when
            there is no longer sufficient maternal antibody to provide full
            protection from infectious disease, but where sufficient antibody
            remains to block the ability of the pup to make its own immune
            response to modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. Traditionally, this
            window has been taken to occur at between 8 – 10 weeks of age, but
            new evidence shows that higher titre vaccines increase maternal
            antibody concentrations leading to persistence of MDA for longer
            periods of time. Studies have now shown that around 1 in every 10
            puppies has ‘blocking’ levels of MDA at 12 weeks of age. For this
            reason, vaccination guidelines now recommend that puppy vaccination
            (with MLV core vaccines) starts at 8 – 9 weeks of age, with a second
            vaccine 3 – 4 weeks later and a third vaccine given between 14 – 16
            weeks of age (preferably at 16 weeks), to ensure that all pups have
            received at least one dose of vaccine in the absence of interfering
            MDA. A 12 month booster vaccine (either at 12 months of age or 12
            months after the 16 week vaccine) is given to ensure full immunity
            develops. Where rabies is endemic, pups should receive 1 dose of
            vaccine at 12 weeks of age, but the VGG suggests that in a high-risk
            situation, a second dose of vaccine may be given 2 &#8211; 4 weeks
            later.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Core Vaccination of Adult Dogs</h2>
          <br class="small" />
          <p>
            For adult dogs, MLV core vaccines should be given no more frequently
            than every 3 years. For CDV, CAV, CPV there is excellent correlation
            between the presence of serum antibody (virus neutralization test or
            haemagglutination inhibition test) and protection from challenge
            with infectious virus. There are extensive data showing that
            protective antibody persists in adult dogs, even when they have only
            been vaccinated as puppies up to 14 years previously [4, 5]. More
            importantly there are data that underpin the legal registration of
            canine core MLV vaccines for either 3 or 4 years, based on challenge
            studies that show that vaccinated dogs resist infection for that
            minimum period after vaccination (the minimum duration of immunity,
            DOI). Other experimental data show that dogs vaccinated as puppies
            only are protected from live virus challenge with CDV and CPV at 9
            years of age [4]. On this basis, most of the internationally
            produced canine MLV core vaccines used in the USA, Europe and
            elsewhere now have a licensed minimum DOI of either 3 or 4 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is also true for most of the internationally produced
            adjuvanted killed rabies vaccines that may legally be given every 3
            years rather than annually. Where such products are available with a
            3-year licensed DOI, but governmental legislation insists on annual
            rabies vaccination, it is beholden on the veterinary profession to
            lobby for changes to the law in order to prevent unnecessary
            revaccination of adult dogs. For example, in the USA, state laws
            changed gradually, such that now every US state stipulates triennial
            revaccination of dogs against rabies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ideal core revaccination schedule for adult dogs would therefore
            be revaccination every third year with CDV, CAV, CPV and rabies.
            Where rabies revaccination is still required annually, the schedule
            might be CDV, CAV and CPV triennially and rabies annually. Triennial
            revaccination reduces the number of unnecessary vaccines given to
            adult dogs and therefore reduces the changes of adverse reactions.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>Non-core Vaccination</h2>
          <br class="small" />
          <p>
            Non-core vaccines should be selected for the individual dog based on
            assessment of that particular animal’s risk of exposure to the
            disease and assessment of the benefits of vaccination to that pet
            versus the risk of adverse reaction. Decision making for non-core
            vaccines would be facilitated by having available good quality data
            and disease distribution maps related to small animal infectious
            diseases. Unfortunately, with the exception of rabies in the USA and
            Europe, such distribution maps are not widely available. Some
            national schemes have been developed by industry or academic groups
            which allow practitioners to input cases of particular infectious
            diseases into a database that presents the information as disease
            distribution maps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monitoring the distribution and evolution of infectious diseases is
            an important part of vaccinology. An excellent example is canine
            leptospirosis, which has recently attracted much research interest
            as the importance of particular serovars in causing canine disease
            in different geographical locations is determined. This new
            knowledge has led to the introduction of tetravalent canine
            leptospirosis vaccines in the US and Europe; the antigenic
            composition of which is related to the prevalence of serovars in
            each location. Similarly, in some countries (e.g. the USA and Korea)
            vaccines are available to protect against strains of canine
            influenza virus (CIV). This infection remains an issue for dogs that
            are intensively kenneled and transported (e.g. racing greyhounds),
            but the CIV vaccine would not be recommended for general use among
            pet dogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non-core vaccines may be included into the puppy vaccination
            schedule if dictated by risk assessment. Intranasal vaccines
            protecting against some elements of the canine infectious
            respiratory disease complex (i.e. CPi and Bordetella bronchiseptica)
            might be used as early as four weeks of age (the VGG currently also
            suggests a second vaccine given 4 weeks later). The VGG recommends
            that where Leptospira vaccines are used in puppies (particularly
            adjuvanted bacterins) that these be given after the MLV core
            vaccines (e.g. at 18 and 22 weeks of age).
          </p>
          <p>
            A major difference between MLV core vaccines and all of the non-core
            vaccines is that noncore vaccines (where used) require annual
            boosters as their DOI is no greater than 12–18 months. Adult dogs
            given non-core vaccines must therefore receive these annually. In
            many situations therefore, adult dogs receive ‘annual
            revaccination’, but just with fewer components than might have been
            used in the past.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>The Annual Health Check</h2>
          <br class="small" />
          <p>
            All aspects of vaccination should fall under an annual health check
            programme that reduces the emphasis on vaccination as a reason for
            visiting the practice and considers holistically the overall health
            and wellbeing of the pet. A discussion about which vaccines (or
            serological tests) might be offered in any one year is just one part
            of the annual health check. The importance of vaccination can be
            reinforced by using the VGG fact sheets. Vaccination (or serology)
            should be appropriately invoiced so emphasis is placed on the
            professional consultation.
